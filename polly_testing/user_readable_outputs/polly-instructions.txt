Using the Polly with Clang and Opt: A Spiritual Guide

About Polly: Polly is an LLVM-IR to LLVM-IR optimizer based on the 
Polyhedral model that is used to improve data-locality and loop 
optimizations. Polly can be used with clang in order to produce 
optimized code during compile time, but cannot accept C code
directly. Instead, source C code must be compiled using clang into
LLVM-IR, (with a .ll extension) before being passed to Polly. This
guide is intended to show how to extract dependencies by manually 
compiling and invoking clang and polly using the opt tool.


#TRANSLATION to LLVM-IR:

> clang <c_file.c> -c -O3 -mllvm -polly -mllvm -polly-dump-before-file=polly_input.ll

outputs the LLVM-IR file that is preoptimized according to -O3 specs by
polly. The -c option here only allows for preprocessing, compiling, and 
assembling steps. 

This command will produce two files - a <name.o> file and the file named
in the actual command. The .ll file is human readable. 

Any .ll file produced by the command above can then be used by the opt
tool. Additionally, the command:

> clang -S -emit-llvm <c_file.c> -o <c_file.s> 

can also be used for LLVM-IR generation without invoking any of polly's
automatic or default behaviors. This should be used for when you want 
to manually execute polly processes individually. After the above 
command, the llvm produced must be converted to canonical form -

> opt -S -polly-canonicalize <c_file.s> > <c_file.preopt.ll>

Now, you should be able to invoke polly options that show SCoP's, an
acronym that I cannot find the meaning of despite hours of reading
documentation. I believe it stands for "Source Code oPtimization",
but there is no Polly option to check. 

To show whether polly has detected any SCoP's, we can run the command:

> opt -polly-ast -analyze -q <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable

#DEPENDENCY Analysis

To show the dependencies found during optimization, we can run the command:

> opt -polly-dependences -analyze <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable

Note that the use of -polly-process-unprofitable in order to invoke optimizations on loops
that polly does not consider worth the overhead of optimization, such as shallow loop
nests. The analyze flag causes analysis to be made, but for no optimizations to be completed.
It only invokes preprocessing, analysis, and compiling. 

To check out more information on the SCoP's you can invoke:

> opt -polly-scops -analyze <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable


List of all commands:

> clang <c_file.c> -c -O3 -mllvm -polly -mllvm -polly-dump-before-file=polly_input.ll

// -O3 is necessary
> clang -O3 -S -emit-llvm <c_file.c> -o <c_file.s> 
> opt -S -polly-canonicalize <c_file.s> > <c_file.preopt.ll>
> opt -polly-ast -analyze -q <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable
> opt -polly-dependences -analyze <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable
> opt -polly-scops -analyze <c_file.preopt.ll> -polly-process-unprofitable

What I used to get dependencies:

> clang -O3 -S -mllvm -polly -emit-llvm loop_opt.c
		---OR---
> clang -O3 -S -emit-llvm loop_opt.c -o loop_opt.s
> opt -O3 -S -polly-canonicalize loop_opt.s > loop.preopt.ll

/* Try adding -O3 option to these */ 

> opt -polly-ast -analyze -q loop.preopt.ll -polly-process-unprofitable
> opt -view-scops -disable-output loop.preopt.ll
> opt -view-scops-only -disable-output loop.preopt.ll
> opt -polly-scops -analyze loop.preopt.ll -polly-process-unprofitable
> opt -polly-dependences -analyze loop.preopt.ll -polly-process-unprofitable
